            More and more knowledge graphs (KGs) are constructed for private use, e.g., Google, or public use, e.g., DBpedia, and Wikidata. These knowledge bases are commonly used to support many AI tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, semantic-data labeling, etc. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs have been positioned as a trustable input source for supporting LLMs in any kind of prompts provided by the users. However, these KGs need to be constructed and maintained, keeping their knowledge up to date and unavailable for effective LLM support. 

            In this tutorial, you will learn best practices for declaratively constructing KGs from heterogeneous input datasets. The tutorial will motivate the necessity of good practices in knowledge management and demonstrate how experts are currently implementing them in real-world projects. The tutorial will be guided by a real use case from the transport domain at the EU level, for integrating several pieces of data and used for route planning across all EU members. At the end of the tutorial, the attendees will be able to set up a sustainable workflow that transforms data in any format into a well-formed and usable KG.

              <div class="subheading mb-1">Part I: Getting started with the Semantic Web stack </div>

              <p> We will briefly introduce the main and W3C recommended technologies used for constructing and exploiting knowledge graphs such as RDF, OWL, RDFS, R2RML, or SPARQL.  </p>

              <div class="subheading mb-1">Part II: The RML specification and its possibilities</div>

              <p> Declarative mappings are commonly used for specifying how a dataset can be transformed into an RDF knowledge graph according to the schema provided, usually in the form of an ontology. We present one of the most popular languages used to this end, RML, and the novel features of its most recent release by the W3C.</p>


              <div class="subheading mb-1">Part III: Creating declarative mapping rules</div>

              <p> Different approaches for mapping creation will be presented. Then, a guided hands-on session will follow with participants to create rules using the user-friendly serialization for RML, YARRRML.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-1">Part IV: KG Construction</div>

              <p> Several engines and approaches will be presented with their advantages and disadvantages. We will show how a KG can be materialized or virtualized and what are the best techniques to be used depending on the use case. Finally, attendees will use an engine to materialize its dataset into RDF.</p>
